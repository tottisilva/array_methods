This is a basic explanation in Portuguese about Array Methods.
For the Object I use some data extract from a API about StarWars characters.
The code was tested with node. 
And the Object I used was this:
const characters = [
    {
        name: 'Luke Skywalker',
        height: '172',
        mass: '77',
        eye_color: 'blue',
        gender: 'male',
    },
    {
        name: 'Darth Vader',
        height: '202',
        mass: '136',
        eye_color: 'yellow',
        gender: 'male',
    },
    {
        name: 'Leia Organa',
        height: '150',
        mass: '49',
        eye_color: 'brown',
        gender: 'female',
    },
    {
        name: 'Anakin Skywalker',
        height: '188',
        mass: '84',
        eye_color: 'blue',
        gender: 'male',
    },
];

In every folder of the method have .txt file with a basic explain how the method works.
All the explains ara in Portuguese.
